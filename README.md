Below you’ll find a suggestion for both a concise **GitHub repository description** (the “About” section) and a more **extensive README.md**. I’ve also recommended a **PSR-4 namespace** that aligns with your company name “JUNU” and the project name “real-adcell.” Feel free to modify any parts to best fit your specific needs.

---

## **GitHub Repository Description (Short)**

> **Sync CSV products to Shopware with OpenAI rewriting and more. A real-world PHP-based example under the JUNU namespace.**

(Or adjust in the “About” section to something similar and short, for example: “Real-world CSV->Shopware Sync demo with ChatGPT rewriting, manufacturer creation, and media uploads.”)

---

## **Recommended Namespace**

A clear and concise **PSR-4** namespace might be:

```
JUNU\RealAdcell
```

- `JUNU` – your company name
- `RealAdcell` – reflects the name of the project (you can style it `RealADCELL`, but typically we use PascalCase)

In your `composer.json`, it would look like:
```jsonc
{
  // ...
  "autoload": {
    "psr-4": {
      "JUNU\\RealAdcell\\": "src/"
    }
  }
  // ...
}
```

## **README.md**

# Real ADCELL Sync

**Repository**: [https://github.com/ju-nu/real-adcell](https://github.com/ju-nu/real-adcell)  
**Namespace**: `JUNU\RealAdcell`  
**Company**: JUNU  

A real-world example of synchronizing CSV-based product data to [Shopware 6](https://www.shopware.com/), featuring integrated usage of [OpenAI](https://openai.com) to rewrite product descriptions, discover categories, and more. This project highlights best practices for handling multiple CSVs, chunk-based or row-based processing, manufacturer creation, image uploads, concurrency considerations, and logging.

## Features

- **CSV Parsing**: Read and parse one or more CSV files; custom mappings supported.  
- **Product Sync**: Create or update Shopware products, including price logic, custom fields, manufacturer creation, etc.  
- **OpenAI Integration**:  
  - Rewrite product descriptions in German, excluding the product title.  
  - Suggest best-fitting categories for new products.  
  - Match suitable delivery times.  
- **Media Upload**: Upload product images to Shopware (with caching to avoid duplicates).  
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logs to both file and console (via [Monolog](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog)).  
- **Environment-Based**: Easy configuration through `.env` (via [vlucas/phpdotenv](https://github.com/vlucas/phpdotenv)).  

---

## Requirements

1. **PHP 8.3+**  
2. **Composer**  
3. **Shopware 6.4+** or 6.5+ with valid API credentials  
4. (Optional) **OpenAI API key** if you plan to use ChatGPT rewriting or category/delivery time suggestions  
5. Write permission for `logs/` (for logging)

---

## Installation

1. **Clone this repository** or download the sources:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ju-nu/real-adcell.git
   ```
2. **Enter the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd real-adcell
   ```
3. **Install dependencies** with Composer:
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```
4. **Copy** the `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust settings:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   - Provide your Shopware API URL, credentials, optional OpenAI key, etc.

---

## Configuration

All configuration happens via **.env** variables. Key points include:

- **Shopware Credentials**  
  - `SHOPWARE_API_URL` – e.g. `https://your-shopware-domain.tld`  
  - `SHOPWARE_CLIENT_ID`, `SHOPWARE_CLIENT_SECRET` – from Shopware’s Integration settings  
  - `SHOPWARE_SALES_CHANNEL_NAME` – default is `Storefront`
- **OpenAI**  
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY` – if left blank, no GPT calls are performed  
  - `OPENAI_MODEL` – e.g. `gpt-4`, `gpt-3.5-turbo`, or your custom model name
- **CSV Definitions**  
  - `CSV_URL_1`, `CSV_ID_1`, `CSV_MAPPING_1`, etc. for each CSV you want to sync  
- **Logging**  
  - `LOG_FILE` – path to your log file, default is `logs/app.log`

### Example
```bash
SHOPWARE_API_URL="https://myshopware.tld"
SHOPWARE_CLIENT_ID="abc123"
SHOPWARE_CLIENT_SECRET="def456"
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-myopenai"
CSV_URL_1="https://example.com/products1.csv"
CSV_ID_1="CSV1"
CSV_MAPPING_1="ext_Streichpreis=Streichpreis|..."
```

---

## Usage

1. **Prepare your `.env`** with valid CSV URLs and Shopware credentials.  
2. **Run the sync** (two ways):
   - Via Composer script:
     ```bash
     composer start
     ```
   - Or directly (Symfony Console):
     ```bash
     php bin/console sync
     ```
3. The script will:
   - Load environment variables  
   - Fetch each CSV, parse it, and unify the rows  
   - For **new products**:
     - Possibly call OpenAI to rewrite descriptions  
     - Suggest best category and delivery time  
     - Create the product with images  
   - For **existing products**:
     - Simply update price, custom fields, and skip GPT calls  

4. **Check your logs** in `logs/app.log` or in the console output to see results.

---

## Detailed Workflow

1. **CSV Fetching & Parsing**  
   - [CsvService](./src/Service/CsvService.php) downloads each CSV, splits it, and normalizes must-have columns.  
   - Mappings such as `ext_Foo=Foo` let you override or merge columns dynamically.
2. **Sync Command**  
   - [SyncCommand](./src/Commands/SyncCommand.php) orchestrates the entire process:
     1. Authenticate against Shopware  
     2. Retrieve categories & delivery times  
     3. For each CSV row, decide if product is new or existing  
     4. If new, gather additional data from OpenAI, create the product  
     5. If existing, skip GPT logic and just update  
     6. Log stats (created, updated, skipped)
3. **ShopwareService**  
   - [ShopwareService](./src/Service/ShopwareService.php) handles API calls to Shopware: manufacturer creation, product creation/update, media, categories, etc.
4. **OpenAiService**  
   - [OpenAiService](./src/Service/OpenAiService.php) performs ChatGPT calls (rewrite, best category, best delivery time).
5. **Logging**  
   - [LoggerFactory](./src/LoggerFactory.php) sets up Monolog to write to both console and file.

## Extending / Contributing

1. **Fork** this repo and create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/my-idea`).  
2. Make changes, add tests or test them locally with your own environment.  
3. **Commit** and push your changes.  
4. **Open** a Pull Request describing the enhancements or bug fixes.  

### Ideas for Extensibility

- **Multithreading / Parallel Processing**: You could split CSV rows into multiple workers or use asynchronous requests for speed.  
- **Additional Shopware Fields**: Extend the payload with more fields, such as advanced properties or custom fields.  
- **Validation**: Add logic to validate CSV data thoroughly before sending to Shopware.  
- **Queue Integration**: Use RabbitMQ or another queue system to distribute large CSVs across multiple worker processes.
